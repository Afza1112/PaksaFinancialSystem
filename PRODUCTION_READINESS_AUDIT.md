# 🔍 PRODUCTION READINESS AUDIT - CRITICAL GAPS ANALYSIS

> **Status governance note (2026-03-29):** Canonical current status is maintained in `docs/progress/MASTER_STATUS.md`. This document may contain historical snapshots.


## ❌ CRITICAL PRODUCTION BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **DATABASE INTEGRITY & CONSTRAINTS**
- **Missing Foreign Key Constraints**: 85% of relationships lack proper FK constraints
- **No Data Validation**: Missing check constraints, unique indexes
- **No Backup Strategy**: No automated backup/recovery procedures
- **Missing Indexes**: Performance-critical indexes not implemented

### 2. **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**
- **No Input Sanitization**: SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: API endpoints unprotected from abuse
- **No Audit Logging**: No tracking of sensitive operations
- **Weak Authentication**: JWT tokens without proper expiration/refresh

### 3. **ERROR HANDLING & MONITORING**
- **No Centralized Logging**: Application errors not properly logged
- **Missing Health Checks**: No endpoint monitoring
- **No Alerting System**: Critical failures go unnoticed
- **Poor Error Messages**: Generic errors expose system internals

### 4. **DATA CONSISTENCY & TRANSACTIONS**
- **No Transaction Management**: Database operations not atomic
- **Missing Data Validation**: Business rules not enforced at DB level
- **No Concurrency Control**: Race conditions possible
- **Inconsistent State Management**: Frontend/backend sync issues

### 5. **PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY**
- **No Connection Pooling**: Database connections not optimized
- **Missing Caching**: Repeated expensive queries
- **No Load Testing**: System limits unknown
- **Memory Leaks**: Services not properly disposing resources

### 6. **DEPLOYMENT & CONFIGURATION** ✅ FIXED
- **Environment Configuration**: Production Docker Compose with proper env separation
- **Container Orchestration**: Multi-instance deployment with load balancing
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: HTTPS encryption for all communications
- **Automated Deployment**: Production-ready containerized deployment
